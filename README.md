# Plex Movie Suggester 

**Version 1.4**

A modern Flask app that connects to your Plex server and suggests a random unwatched movie, TV show, anime, or other video from your Plex library.  
Features a sleek, responsive Plex-themed UI with modern glass morphism design, interactive elements, and comprehensive user engagement tracking.

## ðŸš€ What's New in v1.4

- **Modern UI Overhaul:**  
  Complete visual redesign with glass morphism effects, modern typography (Inter + Poppins fonts), and enhanced animations.
- **Watch Count Tracking:**  
  Track how many users clicked "Watch on Plex" for each item with an eye icon counter.
- **Enhanced Cast Section:**  
  Modern grid layout with glass cards, improved hover effects, and better responsive design.
- **Improved Interactive Elements:**  
  Better buttons with gradient effects, shimmer animations, and consistent Plex theming.
- **GitHub Integration:**

## ðŸš€ What's New in v1.3.2

- **Plex Poster Proxy:**  
  Poster images are now always visible, even when the app is hosted behind a Cloudflare Tunnel or reverse proxy. Posters are fetched from your Plex server by the Flask backend and served to the frontend, so they are accessible from anywhere.
- **Version bump:**  
  Updated version to 1.3.2

---

## ðŸš€ What's New in v1.3

- **Like/Dislike Functionality:**  
  Users can now like or dislike movies and shows.  
  - Like/Dislike counts are displayed and update in real time.
- **Dislike Support:**  
  Dislike button and count added.
- **JWT Authentication:**  
  All like/dislike actions require a valid JWT token.
- **UI Cleanup:**  
  Like/Dislike buttons no longer display emojis, for a cleaner look.
- **Frontend User ID:**  
  Each user gets a unique, persistent ID stored in their browser. JWTs are generated server-side using this ID as the `sub` claim.
- **No Secret in Frontend:**  
  JWT secrets are never exposed to the frontend. All JWTs are issued by the backend.

## Docker

The provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) uses Python 3.11-slim and runs the app with Gunicorn for production readiness.

## Project Structure

- [`app.py`](app.py): Main Flask application.
- [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt): Python dependencies.
- [`templates/`](templates/): HTML templates for the web UI.
- [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile): Docker configuration.

## How it Works

- Fetches all video libraries (Movies, TV, Anime, etc.).
- Picks a random unwatched item from the selected library and displays its details.
- **How it Works** section updated to reflect modern UI and enhanced features
- **Like/Dislike/Watch API** with comprehensive tracking capabilities
- **Enhanced visual design** with glass morphism and modern animations
- **Always provides fallback images** for cast and posters with Plex-themed placeholders
- Allows refreshing for new suggestions while keeping library selection
- **Real-time engagement tracking** with like, dislike, and watch counts

## ðŸ”‘ Like/Dislike/Watch API (v1.3+)

- **Like a movie:**  
  `POST /like/<movie_id>`
- **Unlike a movie:**  
  `DELETE /like/<movie_id>`
- **Dislike a movie:**  
  `POST /dislike/<movie_id>`
- **Remove dislike:**  
  `DELETE /dislike/<movie_id>`
- **Track watch:**  
  `POST /watch/<movie_id>`
- **Get like count:**  
  `GET /like-count/<movie_id>`
- **Get dislike count:**  
  `GET /dislike-count/<movie_id>`
- **Get watch count:**  
  `GET /watch-count/<movie_id>`

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Plex server is accessible from where you run the app (the app must be able to reach Plex).
- Double-check your Plex token and library name.
- If posters are not visible, ensure the backend can reach your Plex server.
- Check logs for errors if the app fails to connect or display items.
