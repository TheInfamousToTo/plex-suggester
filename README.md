# Plex Movie Suggester 

**Version 1.3.2**

A simple Flask app that connects to your Plex server and suggests a random unwatched movie, TV show, anime, or other video from your Plex library.  
It displays posters (proxied through the app for public access), cast info (with robust fallback images), and trailer links, with a sleek Plex-themed UI and a dropdown to select your library.

---

## ðŸš€ What's New in v1.3.2

- **Plex Poster Proxy:**  
  Poster images are now always visible, even when the app is hosted behind a Cloudflare Tunnel or reverse proxy. Posters are fetched from your Plex server by the Flask backend and served to the frontend, so they are accessible from anywhere.
- **Version bump:**  
  Updated version to 1.3.2

---

## ðŸš€ What's New in v1.3

- **Like/Dislike Functionality:**  
  Users can now like or dislike movies and shows.  
  - Like/Dislike counts are displayed and update in real time.
- **Dislike Support:**  
  Dislike button and count added.
- **JWT Authentication:**  
  All like/dislike actions require a valid JWT token.
- **UI Cleanup:**  
  Like/Dislike buttons no longer display emojis, for a cleaner look.
- **Frontend User ID:**  
  Each user gets a unique, persistent ID stored in their browser. JWTs are generated server-side using this ID as the `sub` claim.
- **No Secret in Frontend:**  
  JWT secrets are never exposed to the frontend. All JWTs are issued by the backend.

## Environment Variables

- `PLEX_URL`: Your Plex server URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:32400`)
- `PLEX_TOKEN`: Your Plex authentication token
- `PLEX_LIBRARY`: Default Plex library to suggest from (default: "Movies")

## Usage

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \
  -e PLEX_URL="http://your-plex-server:32400" \
  -e PLEX_TOKEN="your-plex-token" \
  -e PLEX_LIBRARY="Movies" \
  theinfamoustoto/plex-suggester:latest
```

### Running with Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  plex-suggester:
    image: theinfamoustoto/plex-suggester:latest
    container_name: plex-suggester
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      PLEX_URL: "http://your-plex-server:32400"
      PLEX_TOKEN: "your-plex-token"
      PLEX_LIBRARY: "Movies"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theinfamoustoto/plex-suggester.git
    cd plex-suggester
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set environment variables:
    ```bash
    export PLEX_URL="http://your-plex-server:32400"
    export PLEX_TOKEN="your-plex-token"
    export PLEX_LIBRARY="Movies"
    ```

4. Run the app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The app will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Docker

The provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) uses Python 3.11-slim and runs the app with Gunicorn for production readiness.

## Project Structure

- [`app.py`](app.py): Main Flask application.
- [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt): Python dependencies.
- [`templates/`](templates/): HTML templates for the web UI.
- [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile): Docker configuration.

## How it Works

- Connects to your Plex server using the provided URL and token.
- Fetches all video libraries (Movies, TV, Anime, etc.).
- Picks a random unwatched item from the selected library and displays its details.
- **Posters are always visible**: The app proxies poster images from Plex, so they are accessible even when the app is public and Plex is private.
- Always provides a fallback image for cast and posters.
- Allows refreshing for a new suggestion, keeping your library selection.
- **Like/Dislike:** Users can like or dislike a movie/show, and see the current counts.
- **JWTs** are securely issued by the backend using a unique user ID from the frontend.

## ðŸ”‘ Like/Dislike API (v1.3+)

- **Like a movie:**  
  `POST /like/<movie_id>`
- **Unlike a movie:**  
  `DELETE /like/<movie_id>`
- **Dislike a movie:**  
  `POST /dislike/<movie_id>`
- **Remove dislike:**  
  `DELETE /dislike/<movie_id>` 
- **Get like count:**  
  `GET /like-count/<movie_id>`
- **Get dislike count:**  
  `GET /dislike-count/<movie_id>`

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Plex server is accessible from where you run the app (the app must be able to reach Plex).
- Double-check your Plex token and library name.
- If posters are not visible, ensure the backend can reach your Plex server.
- Check logs for errors if the app fails to connect or display items.
