## ðŸš€ What's New in v1.3.2

- **Plex Poster Proxy:**  
  Poster images are now always visible, even when the app is hosted behind a Cloudflare Tunnel or reverse proxy. Posters are fetched from your Plex server by the Flask backend and served to the frontend, so they are accessible from anywhere.
- **Version bump:**  
  Updated version to 1.3.2

---

## ðŸš€ What's New in v1.3

- **Like/Dislike Functionality:**  
  Users can now like or dislike movies and shows.

- **Dislike Support:**  
  Dislike button and count added.
- **JWT Authentication:**  
  All like/dislike actions require a valid JWT token.
- **UI Cleanup:**  
  Like/Dislike buttons no longer display emojis, for a cleaner look.
- **Frontend User ID:**  
  Each user gets a unique, persistent ID stored in their browser. JWTs are generated server-side using this ID as the `sub` claim.
- **No Secret in Frontend:**  
  JWT secrets are never exposed to the frontend. All JWTs are issued by the backend.

## Environment Variables

- `PLEX_URL`: Your Plex server URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:32400`) - **Required**
- `PLEX_TOKEN`: Your Plex authentication token - **Optional** (can be set via web interface)
- `PLEX_LIBRARY`: Default Plex library to suggest from (default: "Movies")
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for JWT token signing (default provided, change in production)

**Note:** When `PLEX_TOKEN` is provided as an environment variable, the app will use it directly and skip the web-based authentication prompt. The app will still obtain JWT tokens for external API integrations (like like/dislike/watch functionality) as needed.

## Usage

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \
  -e PLEX_URL="http://your-plex-server:32400" \
  -e PLEX_TOKEN="your-plex-token" \
  -e JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-secure-secret-key" \
  theinfamoustoto/plex-suggester:latest
```

**Note:** When `PLEX_TOKEN` is provided, the app will use it directly and users won't be prompted for authentication. The app will still handle JWT authentication for external service integrations automatically.

### Running with Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  plex-suggester:
    image: theinfamoustoto/plex-suggester:latest
    container_name: plex-suggester
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      PLEX_URL: "http://your-plex-server:32400"
      PLEX_TOKEN: "your-plex-token"  # Recommended for Docker deployments
      PLEX_LIBRARY: "Movies"
      JWT_SECRET_KEY: "change-this-secret-key-in-production"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Important:** Make sure to change the `JWT_SECRET_KEY` to a secure random value in production.

## Getting Your Plex Token

When you first access the application, you'll be prompted to enter your Plex token. Here's how to find it:

1. **Quick Method (via Plex Web):**
   - Open Plex in your web browser
   - Navigate to any movie or show
   - Click the "..." menu and select "Get Info"
   - Click "View XML" at the bottom
   - Look for `X-Plex-Token` in the URL

2. **Alternative Methods:**
   - Visit the [official Plex support guide](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)
   - Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests to your Plex server

3. **Settings Management:**
   - Once entered, your token is stored securely in your browser
   - Use the Settings button in the app to update or clear your token
   - Tokens are validated against your Plex server before being accepted

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theinfamoustoto/plex-suggester.git
    cd plex-suggester
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set environment variables:

    ```bash
    export PLEX_URL="http://your-plex-server:32400"
    export JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-secure-secret-key"
    # PLEX_TOKEN is optional - you can set it via the web interface
    # export PLEX_TOKEN="your-plex-token"
    export PLEX_LIBRARY="Movies"
    ```

4. Run the app:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The app will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Docker

The provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) uses Python 3.11-slim and runs the app with Gunicorn for production readiness.

## Project Structure

- [`app.py`](app.py): Main Flask application.
- [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt): Python dependencies.
- [`templates/`](templates/): HTML templates for the web UI.
- [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile): Docker configuration.

## How it Works

- Connects to your Plex server using the provided URL and token.
- Fetches all video libraries (Movies, TV, Anime, etc.).
- Picks a random unwatched item from the selected library and displays its details.
- **How it Works** section updated to reflect modern UI and enhanced features
- **Like/Dislike/Watch API** with comprehensive tracking capabilities
- **Enhanced visual design** with glass morphism and modern animations
- **Always provides fallback images** for cast and posters with Plex-themed placeholders
- Allows refreshing for new suggestions while keeping library selection
- **Real-time engagement tracking** with like, dislike, and watch counts
- **Secure JWT authentication** for all user interactions
- **Modern responsive design** that works beautifully on all devices

## ðŸ”‘ Like/Dislike/Watch API (v1.3+)

- **Like a movie:**  
  `POST /like/<movie_id>`
- **Unlike a movie:**  
  `DELETE /like/<movie_id>`
- **Dislike a movie:**  
  `POST /dislike/<movie_id>`
- **Remove dislike:**  
  `DELETE /dislike/<movie_id>`
- **Track watch:**  
  `POST /watch/<movie_id>`
- **Get like count:**  
  `GET /like-count/<movie_id>`
- **Get dislike count:**  
  `GET /dislike-count/<movie_id>`
- **Get watch count:**  
  `GET /watch-count/<movie_id>`

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Plex server is accessible from where you run the app (the app must be able to reach Plex).
- Double-check your Plex token and library name.
- If posters are not visible, ensure the backend can reach your Plex server.
- Check logs for errors if the app fails to connect or display items.
- **For like/dislike/watch functionality:** If these features return 401 errors, ensure that:
  - The external backend service (`https://plex-like.satrawi.cc` in the example) is running and accessible
  - Your Plex token is valid and can authenticate with the external backend
  - The JWT tokens are being obtained correctly (check browser console for authentication messages)
