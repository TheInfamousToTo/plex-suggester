# Plex Movie Suggester 

**Version 1.3**

A simple Flask app that connects to your Plex server and suggests a random unwatched movie, TV show, anime, or other video from your Plex library.  
It displays posters, cast info (with robust fallback images), and trailer links, with a sleek Plex-themed UI and a dropdown to select your library.

    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```

3. Set environment variables:
    ```bash

## Docker

The provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) uses Python 3.11-slim and runs the app with Gunicorn for production readiness.

## Project Structure

- [`app.py`](app.py): Main Flask application.
- [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt): Python dependencies.
- [`templates/`](templates/): HTML templates for the web UI.
- [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile): Docker configuration.

## How it Works

- Connects to your Plex server using the provided URL and token.
- Fetches all video libraries (Movies, TV, Anime, etc.).
- Picks a random unwatched item from the selected library and displays its details.
- Always provides a fallback image for cast and posters.
- Allows refreshing for a new suggestion, keeping your library selection.
- **NEW in v1.3:** Users can like or dislike a movie/show, and see the current counts.

## ðŸ”‘ Like/Dislike API (v1.3+)

- **Like a movie:**  
  `POST /like/<movie_id>` (JWT required)
- **Unlike a movie:**  
  `DELETE /like/<movie_id>` (JWT required)
- **Dislike a movie:**  
  `POST /dislike/<movie_id>` (JWT required)
- **Remove dislike:**  
  `DELETE /dislike/<movie_id>` (JWT required)
- **Get like count:**

- **Get dislike count:**  
  `GET /dislike-count/<movie_id>`

## Troubleshooting
